# Exercism Solutions

This repo just hosts my solutions for Exercism exercises. I'm currently working on the C# track,  
and the solutions can be found in each problem's .cs file.  
The test files contain all the tests to be passed for the problem to be considered completed.  
I'll be commiting to this repo every time I pass a problem and am hoping to solve one every 2-3 days.

## About Exercism

Exercism is an awesome, awesome site where you can download coding challenges in a variety of programming languages the just help reinforce your problem solving skills and language mastery.  
They have their built in text editor for solving the problems, but I recommend using the CLI tool they have to work in your IDE.
